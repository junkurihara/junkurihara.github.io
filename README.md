# Jun KURIHARA

## Introduction of myself

I am currently an Associate Professor at [Graduate School of Applied Informatics, University of Hyogo](https://www.ai.u-hyogo.ac.jp/english/), Japan since Jan. 2020. I am also a Principle Researcher at [Zettant Inc.](https://www.zettant.com/) since Jan. 2018. I have been working for KDDI Corp. and KDDI R&D Labs., Inc. (Now KDDI Research, Inc.) from Apr. 2006 to Dec. 2017 as a strategic planner and a researcher for security, applied mathematics and networking architecture. I received BE, ME, and PhD in Engineering all from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2004, 2006 and 2012, respectively.

My detailed CV is given here: [[pdf at github.com]](https://github.com/junkurihara/junkurihara.github.io/blob/master/cv/cv-en.pdf)

My current research interests are in:

- Information security and privacy mechanisms using coding theoretic techniques, e.g., secret sharing, private information retrieval, etc.
- Edge computing architecture, its security and privacy, e.g., new theoretical (and mathematical) framework of secure communication and computation, privacy-preserving computation at untrusted third-party edge environment.
- Information-centric networking (Named-data networking; NDN) and its brand-new security mechanisms, e.g., security in edge named function environment.
