# Jun KURIHARA

I am currently an Associate Professor at [Graduate School of Applied Informatics, University of Hyogo](https://www.ai.u-hyogo.ac.jp/english/), Japan since Jan. 2020. I am also a Principle Researcher at [Zettant Inc.](https://www.zettant.com/) since Jan. 2018. I have been working for KDDI Corp. and KDDI R&D Labs., Inc. (Now KDDI Research, Inc.) as a researcher for security, applied mathematics and networking architecture.

My detailed CV is given here: [[pdf at github.com]](https://github.com/junkurihara/CV)

My current interests are in:

- Information security and privacy mechanisms using coding theoretic techniques, e.g., secret sharing, private information retrieval.
- Edge computing architecture, its security and privacy, e.g., new theoretical framework of secure communication and computation, privacy-preserving computation at third party edge environment.
- Information-centric networking (Named-data networking; NDN) and its security mechanisms.
