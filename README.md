# Jun KURIHARA

## Who am I?

I am currently a Principal Researcher (Softoware Engineer) at [Zettant Inc.](https://www.zettant.com/), Japan since Jan. 2018. I am also an Associate Professor at [Graduate School of Information Science, University of Hyogo](https://www.u-hyogo.ac.jp/gsis/index_en.html), Japan since Jan. 2020, and a Visiting Scholar at [ATR Inc.](https://www.atr.jp/), Japan since May. 2020. I have been working for KDDI Corp. and KDDI R&D Labs., Inc. (Now KDDI Research, Inc.), Japan from Apr. 2006 to Dec. 2017 as a strategic planner and a researcher for security, applied mathematics and networking architecture. I had been with Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), CA, USA as a visiting researcher. I received BE, ME, and PhD in Engineering all from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2004, 2006 and 2012, respectively.

My detailed CV is given [here (pdf)](./cv/cv-en.pdf).

My current development projects and research interests are in:

- Information security and privacy mechanisms using coding theoretic techniques, e.g., secret sharing, private information retrieval, etc.
- New computing and networking architecture and so-called 'security-by-design'. Currently, I am interested in edge computing architecture, its security and privacy, e.g., new theoretical (and mathematical) framework of secure in-networking communication and computation, privacy-preserving computation at untrusted third-party edge environment.
- Information-centric networking (Named-data networking; NDN) and its brand-new security mechanisms, e.g., security in edge named function environment.
- Privacy and security in Domain Name Systems (DNS) on the Internet.
